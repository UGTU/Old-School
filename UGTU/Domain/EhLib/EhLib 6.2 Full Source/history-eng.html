<h4>Version 6.2</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p id="left-margin-0-5"> + DropDownForms technology - customizing  droped down windows.</p>
  <p id="margin0-5">Typical DropDown window - is the list that appears in the TComboBox control when you click on the edit button with down arrow in the control.<br>
  New technology of DropDropForms allows you to create forms that appear and work similarly to the drop down list of TComboBox. These forms can be displayed by pressing one of the edit buttons within controls TDBEditEh, TDBNumberEditEh, TInplaceEditor in DBGridEh etc.</p>
  <p id="margin0-5">
  See detailed description of using DropDownForms in the document &lt;<u>About EhLib 6.2 Eng.doc</u>&gt;; Section - DropDownForms </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>New properties to customize the drop-down Form are in the following classes:<br />
    (For DBGridEh)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>TColumnEh.DropDownFormParam<br />
    TColumnEh.EditButtons[i].DropDownFormParam</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(For DBVertGridEh)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>TFieldRowEh.DropDownFormParam<br />
      TFieldRowEh.EditButtons[i].DropDownFormParam<br />
      <br />
      TDBEditEh.EditButton.DropDownFormParam<br />

  controls.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>(In DBVertGridEh)</strong></p>
  <p id="red-line">+ Added possiblity to group rows into categories. See TDBVertGridEh.RowCategories property.</p>
  <p id="margin0-5">Assign category name in the property TFieldRowEh.CategoryName.<br />
  The rows can be grouped by: Category Title, Field Type  or presence/absence of values ??in the current record.</p>
  <p id="red-line">+ Added possiblity to sort the rows by the row captions. See property TDBVertGridEh.RowsSortOrder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>(Â DBGridEh)</strong></p>
  <p id="red-line">+ In DBGridEh at Design-Time it is allowed to create DB components and assign DataSource and DataSource.DataSet properties. Right-click above the Design-Time panel in the lower right corner of the Grid and select the menu to assign or create a required component.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>(Â TIniPropStorageManEh)</strong></p>
  <p id="red-line">* In the TIniPropStorageManEh.WritePropertiesText method the class that is used to write data to a file is changed. Instead of TIniFile the TMemIniFile is now used. It accelerated the write operation to the file, but changed the location of the file when IniFileName property is not specified a full path. The new version of the file will be saved in the current directory instead of the WINDOWS directory.</p>

<h4><strong>Version 5.6</strong> </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> * Fixed handling of the global variable OldStyleFlatBorder.<br />
    In previous versions, if OldStyleFlatBorder = False (default value is False), then if TDBEditEh.Flat = True then <br />
    drawing boundaries of TDBEditEh in Flat style never worked. In this version, if OldStyleFlatBorder = False then drawing boundaries of TDBEditEh in Flat style will work when the Windwos is in the Classic style and drawing Flat border will not work when the Windwos is in Themed environments and<br />
  application use Themes.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Version 5.4</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> + In DBGridEh. Checkboxes can be shown in the indicator column. Checkboxes is used to select records in the Grid. Also it is needed to customise properties of the Grid to allow selecting records: dgMultiSelect in Options, gstRecordBookmarks in AllowedSelections.</p>
  <p> + In DBGridEh. IndicatorOptions property of TDBGridEhIndicatorOptions was added. <br />
    TDBGridEhIndicatorOptions = set of TDBGridEhIndicatorOption;<br />
    TDBGridEhIndicatorOption = (gioShowRowIndicatorEh, gioShowRecNoEh, <br />
    gioShowRowselCheckboxesEh);<br />
    gioShowRowIndicatorEh - have same meaning as dgIndicator in Options.<br />
    gioShowRecNoEh - have same meaning as dghShowRecNo in OptionsEh.<br />
    gioShowRowselCheckboxesEh - show checkboxes in the indocator column.</p>
  <p> + In MemTableEh. The principle of storing data for Calculated and Lookup fields was changed. Now values of these fields are stored in a special buffer for each record, and they are not recalculated each time when the data in the grid is repainted or scrolled. It allows to increase speed of showing data of Lookup and Calculated fields in the DBGridEh. Calculated and Lookup fields are recalculated only when the MemTableEh is opened or when record is updated.</p>
  <p> * Changes in the MemTableEh. If the MemTableEh is connected to DataDriver and fields are created in Design-Time (as Persistent Field Components), then the MemTableEh creates internal structure of records taking description from Persistent Fields rather than taking structure from the DataDriver. On loading data from DataDriver it is not necessary that types and number of fields in the MemTableEh have the same structure as records which are delivered from the DataDriver. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Version 5.3</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> + Added support of Embarcadero RAD Studio XE</p>
  <p>+ Added Options property in MemTableEh of TMemTableOptionsEh type.<br />
    TMemTableOptionsEh = set of TMemTableOptionEh; TMemTableOptionEh = (mtoTextFieldsCaseInsensitive);<br />
    mtoTextFieldsCaseInsensitive - Defines whether string fields should be compared in a case-sensitive or case-insensitive manner when data is sorting and filtering.<br />
    <br />
    + Added printing of grouped data in TPrintDBGridEh when Grid.DataGrouping is active. Use TPrintDBGridEh component to print and preview data.</p>
  <p> + Added CommandTimeout property in TADOCommandEh component.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Version 5.2</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> + Added feature to group data in the DBGridEh.<br />
    It is allowed to make grouping at run-time and design-time.<br />
    Grouping works only when the grid is connected to TMemTableEh dataset.<br />
    <br />
    Use next subproperties of Grid.DataGrouping property to adjust grouping<br />
    Active: Boolean - Set this propery true to active grouping.<br />
    DefaultStateExpanded: Boolean - defines initial expapnding/collapsing state of new created elements of the grouping tree.<br />
    GroupLevels: TGridDataGroupLevelsEh - Collection of group levels. Use this property to create template of the grouping.<br />
    GroupPanelVisible: Boolean - Set this property to True to show special panel at the top part of the grid. Then the panel is thisible it is allowed to form group levels by mouse. Drag title of the requaried column to the group panel and drop it onto panel. <br />
    Font: TFont - Controls the attributes of the default font of group records in the grid.<br />
    Color: Tcolor - Default background color of the group records.</p>
  <p> See demonstration project of grouping in Demos\DataGrouping directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Version 5.1</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> * The type of RowPanel property was changed. Instead of Boolean type, now it <br />
    is an object property with subproperies:<br />
    Active: Boolean - Defines if it is possible to place cells under each over and if every propetry can have personal hight.</p>
  <p> +   NavKeysNavigationType: TGridRowPanelNavKeysNavigationTypeEh - defines the order of navigation over cells in the grid when keys Up, Down, Left, Right are pressed. rpntRowToRowEh - (by default) Keys Up, Down move current cell to next or previouse record of dataset. Keys Left, Rigth works as Tab and Shift-Tab<br />
    rpntCellToCellEh - Keys Up, Down move current cell to under or above last position from the current cell. Keys Left, Rigth move current cell to left or right position from the current cell.</p>
  <p> +   TabNavigationType: TGridRowPanelTabNavigationTypeEh - defines an order of going through cells of the grid by Tab key rpntUpToDownPriorityEh - Go, at first, from top to bottom, than from <br />
    left to right. rpntLeftToRightPriorityEh - Go, at first, from left to right, than from top to bottom.</p>
  <p> + A program for automatically installing library in Delphi/C++ Builder IDE is added. The program is located in Installer\EhLibInstaller.exe. In time of installation the program creates folder, copies files, compile required packages and register packages in the IDE.</p>
  <p> + crpRowPanelColPlacementEh value is added in TColumnEhRestoreParam type, grpRowPanelColPlacementEh values is added in TDBGridEhRestoreParam type. Now, procedure RestoreGridLayout can restore cell positions then RowPanel is active.</p>
  <p> + Propery RowDetailPanelControl is added in public section. Use this property to add components on panel of detail information at RunTime.<br />
    Use next code: MyControl.Parent := DBGridEh1.RowDetailPanelControl;</p>
  <p> + Next subproperties were added in propery Grid.STFilter: InstantApply: Boolean - defines if filter will be applied on chanching or clising of droped down list of filtered values (STFilter). Location: TSTFilterLocationEh - defines the location STFilter. Under the title (stflUnderTitleFilterEh) or in the title (stflInTitleFilterEh). When in the title then STFilter doesn't support edit line to enter filter expression.</p>
  <p> + The interface of droped down list of SubTitleFilter was changed. Now it is allowed to select requaried values in the list unsing checkboxes. The Item (Custom...) was added in the list of commands of filter droped <br />
    down list. When selected, the simple filter dialog appeares to enter filter expression. </p>
  <p> + When the list of items for droped down filter list is formed, the current filter takes in account (Only when grid is conneccted to TMemTableEh).</p>
  <p> + Global variable DBGridEhShowInTitleFilterBox was added. It contains keys shortcut to open droped down list of the STFilter when STFilter.Location = stflInTitleFilterEh. By default it contains 'Ctrl-T'.<br />
    <br />
    + New type of event was defined:<br />
    TDBGridEhFillSTFilterListValuesEvent = procedure(Sender: TCustomDBGridEh; Column: TColumnEh; Items: TStrings; var Processed: Boolean) of object; The event of this type was added in Grid (TDBGridEh.OnFillSTFilterListValues), in the grid column (TColumnEh.OnFillSTFilterListValues) and in the <br />
    TDBGridEhCenter (TDBGridEhCenter.OnFillSTFilterListValues) Write this event to fill list of droped down list of STFilter cell. You can can call default event handler DefaultFillSTFilterListValues. Every item of<br />
    list Items must consist from to elements: String Items[i] and Object Items.Objects[i]. Items of Object type must be inherited from TPopupListboxItemEh type and must be created as a global objects. <br />

    DatasetFeatures.FillSTFilterListDataValues to fill list of the unique values of the column. Realization of tha last procedure depends of the type of DataSet. Currently onle TMemTableEh type of DataSet can fill <br />
    unique values of the column. Rewrite TDatasetFeaturesEh.FillSTFilterListDataValues method to fill unique values for other type of DataSets.<br />
    </p>
  <p>See info about TDatasetFeaturesEh in Ehlib documentation and EhLibMTE.Pas.<br />
    <br />
    + New properties added to TDBGridEhCenter class: <br />
    STFilterDefaultStringOperator, STFilterDefaultNumberOperator, STFilterDefaultDateTimeOperator, STFilterDefaultBooleanOperator. Use this properties to set default operator that will be used when <br />
    string in the STFilter doesn't containt operator. The operators can be assigend appart for String fields, Numeric fields, DataTime fields and logical fields.</p>

<h4>Version 4.5</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> + Added TextEditing property in the TColumnEh object. Use this property to ban <br />
    showing text editor in the data column cell.</p>
  <p> + Added OnHintShowPause event in the TColumnEh object and TDBGridEh . Write this <br />
    event to set duration pause before showing hint.</p>
  <p> + In TColumnEh object and TDBGridEh is added OnDataHintShow event. Write this <br />
    event to set text, font, color, position and other parameters of hint <br />
    window for every data cell in the the grid column. This event is call only <br />
    if Grid.ShowHint is True.</p>
  <p> + In TColumnEh object and TDBGridEh added OnAdvDrawDataCell event. Write <br />
    this event to draw data in the data cell of column. This event calls always<br />
    regardless of Grid.DefaultDrawing property. Set Processed to true to define <br />
    that you processed drawing in the event code. Otherwise grid will call <br />
    default method for drawing. You can, if need, change parameters  ARect and <br />
    Params and call Grid.DefaultDrawColumnDataCell or you can leave Processed <br />
    in False and don't call Grid.DefaultDrawColumnDataCell. In last case<br />
    OnAdvDrawDataCell will work like OnGetCellParams event.</p>
  <p> + In TColCellParamsEh class added properties:<br />
    BlankCell: Boolean. Set this property to force show cell as a blank <br />
    3D cell.<br />
    SuppressActiveCellColor: Boolean. Set this property to suppress color <br />
    of the active cell by the color that you set in the Background property.<br />
    TextEditing: Boolean. Set this property to ban showing text editor in the <br />
    data cell.<br />
    TColCellParamsEh class is used in such events as OnGetCellParams and <br />
    OnAdvDrawDataCell.<br />
    TColCellParamsEh class is used as a type of Params parameter in such events as<br />
    OnGetCellParams and OnAdvDrawDataCell.</p>
  <p> * Some bugfixes.</p>
  <p>Version 4.4</p>
  <p> + Added possibility to move the column by in the grid at Design-Time.</p>
  <p> + Added possibility to select the column in the Object Inspector by clicking <br />

  <p> + Added property DrawGraphicData: Boolean. When property is True, the grid <br />
    draws image from TBlobField with BlobType = ftGraphic in graphic mode.</p>
  <p> + Added OnGetRowHeight event. Write this event to set height of every data row <br />
    in the grid. The Event is caused when data is changed in DataSet. <br />
    The Event is caused only when grid is connected to TMemTableEh and MemTable <br />
    not in TreeView mode.</p>
  <p> + Added dghAutoFitRowHeight in TDBGridEhOption type (OptionsEh). In this mode <br />
    the grid calculate height of lines dynamically using text in data cells for <br />
    a columns that TColumnEh.WordWrap = True. This mode works only when <br />
    grid is connected to TMemTableEh and MemTable not in mode TreeView.<br />
    Grid updates the height of the lines not in all cases. For instance, grid <br />
    does not update the height of the lines when you change Grid.Font property. <br />
    In this case you need to call Grid.UpdateAllDataRowHeights where this is <br />
    necessary.</p>
  <p> + In the mode when dgRowSelect is in Options, scrollbar works in smooth mode. <br />
    (The Step of runner is not limited by the ñolumn width).</p>

    Now you can control of resizing and moving of columns separately.</p>
  <p> + Added dghShowRecNo in TDBGridEhOption type (OptionsEh). Set this value to show <br />
    record number in the indicator column. It works only for DataSet which<br />
    IsSequenced = True.</p>
  <p> + Drawing of 3D title cells in Flat mode is changed. When <br />
    ThemeServices.ThemesEnabled = True, grid draws 3D cells in gradient style.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Version 3.2<br />
  <br />
  </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In TDBGridEh </strong><br />
    + Added ability to fill cell by the value from previous record. <br />
    You can use &quot;Ctrl+'&quot; key to do it.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> + Added dghDblClickOptimizeColWidth value to the TDBGridEhOption type<br />
    (property OptionsEh). Adding this value to OptionsEh property<br />
    allows grid to set optimal column width (to fit text in cells of column).<br />
    on double-click on ColSizing line.</p>
  <p> + Added ability to show special row (under title) where you can enter <br />
    expressions in cells for filtering records in dataset. <br />
    (Expression in the cell can look like: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;&gt;=1&quot;, &quot;&gt;1 AND &lt;=5&quot;, &quot;%TestStr%&quot;)<br />
    When cursor reside in the filter cell they can press ENTER to apply filter.</p>
  <p> For automatically filtering data in dataset need to add one of the units <br />
    EhLib... (EhLibADO, EhLibBDE, EhLibCDS) to 'uses' clause of any unit of your<br />
    project. Now EhLib have objects to filter data in the TClientDataSet, TQuery,<br />
    TTable and TADOQuery. You have to write and register your own object to filter <br />
    data in DataSet that not present in this list or you can write <br />
    TDBGridEh.OnApplyFilter event for every grid.</p>
  <p> Added property - STFilter: TSTDBGridEhFilter with subproperties:<br />
    property Local: Boolean - grid does not use it, but object that<br />
    perform filtering can determine whether it will filter locally <br />
    in dataset or on the server (by adding filter expressions in <br />
    SQL 'WHERE' clause).<br />
    property Visible: Boolean - Specifies whether the filter row is visible.</p>
  <p> + Added OnApplyFilter event.</p>
  <p> + Added ApplyFilter function in TDatasetFeaturesEh class.</p>

    with properties<br />
    DataField: String - Specifies the field name that use to <br />
    filter data if Column.FieldName is not fit for it.<br />
    Visible: Boolean - Specifies whether user can enter expressions<br />
    in filter row for this column.<br />
    ExpressionStr: String - text expression in StFilter cell.<br />
    Expression: TSTFilterExpressionEh - coded expression in StFilter cell.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Version 3.1</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> * Changes in TRegPropStorageManEh:<br />
    'Key' property moved from 'published' to 'public' part.<br />
    (C++ Builder does not support HKEY type in published part).</p>
  <p> Added RegistryKey property of TRegistryKeyEh type.</p>
  <p> + Added (in source included version only) preview version of the<br />
    TMemTableEh component. Dataset, which hold all its data in memory, <br />
    furthermore can fetch data from other dataset's, unload changes <br />
    back to dataset and support special interface, that allow to <br />
    view all data without changing active record.</p>
  <p> See detail info in AdvTech\MemTableEh\readme.txt dir.</p>
  <p> + In DBGridEh: Added support of IMemTableEh interface in DataSet <br />
    that allow to view all data, without changing active record.<br />
  </p>

<h4>Version 3.0</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p> In TDBDateTimeEditEh</p>
  <p> + New values in TDateTimeKindEh type (property Kind).<br />
    TDateTimeKindEh = (dtkDateEh, dtkTimeEh, dtkDateTimeEh, dtkCustomEh);<br />
    + Added EditFormat property. Now you can type custom date/time format using<br />
    next format elements: 'YY', 'YYYY', 'MM', 'DD', 'HH', 'NN', 'SS'.<br />
  </p>
  <p> Library is divided to design-time and run-time packages.<br />
    EhLib[XX] - run-time package and DclEhLib[X] - design-time packages, <br />
    where [XX] is digit number of VCL version:<br />
    [40] for Delphi 4, [50] for Delphi 5, etc;<br />
    And EhLibB[XX] with DclEhLibB[XX] for C++ Builder.<br />
  </p>
  <p> Upon installation, all components is placed to the separate page in<br />
    components palette with name - 'EhLib'.<br />
    Note that Delphi IDE does not move components to the new default <br />
    place when you install new version of same component(s). So if you <br />
    already has EhLib installed, then installation new (3.0) version <br />
    does not move EhLib components to the 'EhLib' page on components palette. <br />
    To force Delphi IDE to move compontes to the default place on <br />
    components palette do next:<br />
    Open menu: Component-&gt;Configure Palette.<br />
    Select '[All]' line in Pages listbox.<br />
    Click 'Default Pages' button.<br />
  </p>
  <p> New componetns: TPropStorageEh, TIniPropStorageManEh, TRegPropStorageManEh.<br />
